# WeatherWise

## Project Description

**Objective**: WeatherWise is a web-based weather application that allows users to enter a location and retrieve the current weather conditions for that location. The app displays details such as temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the current weather.

### Skills Practiced:
- **HTML**: For structuring the app.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching weather data and interactivity.
- **API Integration**: Using a public weather API.

### Project Requirements

- **User Input**: The app includes a text input field where users can enter the name of a city or location for which they want to check the weather.
- **Submit Button**: A "Submit" button triggers the weather data retrieval when clicked.
- **Display Weather Data**: After submission, the app displays the current weather conditions for the entered location, including temperature (in Celsius), weather description (e.g., "Sunny," "Cloudy," "Rainy"), and an icon representing the current weather condition.
- **Styling**: CSS is applied to make the app visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly.
- **Public Weather API**: The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.
- **Error Handling**: The app includes error handling for invalid locations or API issues, with appropriate error messages displayed to the user.
